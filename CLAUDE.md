# Claude Code Project Notes

## Available Skills

- **`/onboarding`** - Interactive guided deployment of your own CodInspect instance. Walks through
  repository setup, credential collection, Terraform deployment, and verification with user handoffs
  as needed.

## Deploying Your Own Instance

For a complete guide to deploying your own instance of CodInspect, see
**[docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)**.

Alternatively, run `/onboarding` for an interactive guided setup.

## Modal Infrastructure

### Deployment

**Never deploy `src/app.py` directly** - it only defines the app and shared resources, not the
functions.

Two valid deployment methods:

```bash
cd packages/modal-infra

# Method 1: Use deploy.py wrapper (recommended)
modal deploy deploy.py

# Method 2: Deploy the src package directly
modal deploy -m src
```

Both methods work because they import `src/__init__.py` which registers all function modules
(functions, web_api, scheduler) with the app.

**Common mistake**: Running `modal deploy src/app.py` will succeed but deploy nothing useful - no
endpoints will be created because `app.py` doesn't import the function modules.

### Web Endpoints

Web endpoints use the `@fastapi_endpoint` decorator and are exposed at:

```
https://{workspace}--{app}-{function_name}.modal.run
```

For example (replace `<workspace>` with your Modal workspace name):

- `api_create_sandbox` → `https://<workspace>--CodInspect-api-create-sandbox.modal.run`
- `api_health` → `https://<workspace>--CodInspect-api-health.modal.run`

Function names with underscores become hyphens in URLs.

### Secrets

Create Modal secrets via CLI:

```bash
modal secret create <secret-name> KEY1="value1" KEY2="value2"
```

Reference in code:

```python
my_secret = modal.Secret.from_name("secret-name", required_keys=["KEY1", "KEY2"])

@app.function(secrets=[my_secret])
def my_func():
    os.environ.get("KEY1")
```

### API Authentication

Modal HTTP endpoints require HMAC authentication from the control plane. This prevents unauthorized
access to sandbox creation, snapshot, and restore endpoints.

**Required secret**: `MODAL_API_SECRET` - A shared secret for HMAC-signed tokens.

The secret is managed via Terraform (`terraform/environments/production/`):

- Add `modal_api_secret` to your `.tfvars` file (generate with: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- Terraform configures it for both services:
  - Control plane worker: `module.control_plane_worker.secrets`
  - Modal app: `module.modal_app.secrets` (as `internal-api` secret)

The control plane generates time-limited HMAC tokens that Modal endpoints verify. Tokens expire
after 5 minutes to prevent replay attacks.

### Image Builds

To force an image rebuild, update the `CACHE_BUSTER` variable in `src/images/base.py`:

```python
CACHE_BUSTER = "v24-description-of-change"
```

### Common Issues

1. **"modal-http: invalid function call"** - Usually means the function isn't registered with the
   app. Ensure:
   - The module is imported in `deploy.py`
   - You're deploying `deploy.py`, not just `app.py`

2. **Import errors with relative imports** - Modal runs code in a special context. Use the
   `deploy.py` pattern that adds `src` to sys.path.

3. **Pydantic dependency issues** - Use lazy imports inside functions to avoid loading pydantic at
   module import time:
   ```python
   @app.function()
   def my_func():
       from .sandbox.types import SessionConfig  # Lazy import
   ```

## GitHub App Authentication

> **Single-Tenant Design**: The GitHub App configuration uses a single installation ID
> (`GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`) shared by all users. This means any user can access any repository
> the App is installed on. This system is designed for internal/single-tenant deployment only.

### Required Secrets

GitHub App credentials (`GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`) are
needed by **two services**:

1. **Modal sandbox** - for cloning repos and pushing commits
2. **Control plane** - for listing installation repositories (`/repos` endpoint)

The Terraform configuration (`terraform/environments/production/main.tf`) passes these to both:

- `module.control_plane_worker.secrets` - for the `/repos` API endpoint
- `module.modal_app.secrets` - for git operations in sandboxes

If the control plane is missing these secrets, the `/repos` endpoint returns "GitHub App not
configured" and the web app's repository dropdown will be empty.

### Token Lifetime

- GitHub App installation tokens expire after **1 hour**
- Generate fresh tokens for operations that may happen after startup

### Key Format

- Cloudflare Workers require **PKCS#8** format for private keys
- Convert from PKCS#1:
  `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in key.pem -out key-pkcs8.pem`

### Token Flow

```
Startup (git sync):  Modal → generate token → GITHUB_APP_TOKEN env var → sandbox
Push (PR creation):  Control plane → generate fresh token → WebSocket → sandbox
PR API:              Control plane → user OAuth token → GitHub API (server-side only)
```

## Control Plane (Cloudflare Workers)

### Deployment

The control plane is deployed via Terraform. See [terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md) for
details.

All secrets and environment variables are configured through Terraform's `terraform.tfvars` file.

### Durable Objects

Sessions use Durable Objects with SQLite storage. Key patterns:

- Hibernation support - WebSockets survive hibernation but in-memory state is lost
- Use `ctx.getWebSockets()` to recover WebSocket references after hibernation
- Store critical state in SQLite, not just memory

## Testing

### End-to-End Test Flow

```bash
# Create session (replace <your-subdomain> with your Cloudflare Workers subdomain)
curl -X POST https://CodInspect-control-plane.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"repoOwner":"owner","repoName":"repo"}'

# Send prompt
curl -X POST https://.../sessions/{sessionId}/prompt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"...","authorId":"test","source":"web"}'

# Check events
curl https://.../sessions/{sessionId}/events
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# Modal logs
modal app logs CodInspect

# Cloudflare logs (via dashboard)
# Go to Workers & Pages → Your Worker → Logs
```
